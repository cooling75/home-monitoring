# home-monitoring

Project to monitor electricity, water and natural gas consumption. Hardware is a D1Mini ESP8266 microcontroller development board for electricity and gas, water is based on the ESP32-CAM board.

## Commodities

### Electricity

Power meter is a Holleytech DTZ 541-ZEBA from or version 2021.  
The date is important since the SML byte order has changed from 2019 to 2021.

#### Sensor

As a write-read head I use a [Osram SFH 3100 F](https://www.osram.com/ecat/Radial%20Mini%20Sidelooker%20SFH%203100%20F/com/en/class_pim_web_catalog_103489/prd_pim_device_2219661/) phototransistor and 1 kOhm resistor. For testing purposes I cut a hole into a piece of cardboard at the position of the diode of the power meter. The first examples I did with an Arduino Uno for byte sequence debugging.

Current setup consists of two pieces of stripboard. One holds the transistor and the other one the D1Mini plus pulldown resistor connected with a pair of short cables. (Image is wrong regarding the pulldown resistor.)

### Gas

#### Sensor

The sensor is a simple reed switch or reed contact. The last number on the meter contains a magnet which increments the gas meter count by 0.01 mÂ³ when it passes the zero. I used the debounce example of the Arduino IDE and extended it by WiFi manager and MQTT client for value submission.

### Water

Not started yet.

## Data processing

My approach is based on a K3s cluster on Raspberry Pis (because it is already available), but native or docker software deployment should work alike.

A(ESP8266)-->|MQTT| B(mosquitto broker on K3s);
B-->|telegraf| C(InfluxDB);
```

### Storage (InfluxDB)

Create namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace home-mon
```

Add helm repository

```bash
helm repo add influxdata https://helm.influxdata.com/
```

Install InfluxDB

```bash
helm install influx influxdata/influxdb \
        --set image.tag=1.8.10 -n home-mon
```
