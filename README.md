# home-monitoring

Project to monitor electricity, water and natural gas consumption.

## Electricity

Power meter is a Holleytech DTZ 541-ZEBA from or version 2021.  
The date is important since the SML byte order has changed from 2019 to 2021.

### Sensor

As a write-read head I use a [Osram SFH 3100 F](https://www.osram.com/ecat/Radial%20Mini%20Sidelooker%20SFH%203100%20F/com/en/class_pim_web_catalog_103489/prd_pim_device_2219661/) phototransistor and 1 kOhm resistor. For testing purposes I cut a hole into a piece of cardboard at the position of the diode of the power meter.
